We'll, although I told you not to look through the files, here you are.
I tried to replicate the Undertale font but bold letters would be so bold that you couldn't see any spaces inbetween the letters itself.
So I've changed them a bit to not display as a square and well...
It looks kinda trash so yeah, that's why it's unused...

You wanna try the font anyways?
See that "ascii_unused.png"?
Remove the "_unused" and it'll be your new font.
